This document starts with some observations about some pieces of the CSS box model that are tricky to implement, and then describes how they are currently implemented in Gecko and how I believe they could be implemented better.

## Observations ##

### The anchor point for a float need not be at a line breaking opportunity ###

Conceptually, although it's not described in the spec, floats have a
place that they come from:  essentially, where they would have been if
they'd been a non-floated inline.  In Gecko, we actually place an empty
inline there and call it the float's placeholder.  It probably makes
more sense to call it the float's anchor point.

There's no requirement that this anchor point be at a line breaking
opportunity.  It's perfectly legal markup to write:

    <p>This is a ridicul<img style="float:left">ous example.</p>

This is interesting because the 
[float placement rules](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#float-position)
in CSS 2 (also see
[why they're bad](http://dbaron.org/log/20120827-specification-style))
generally want the float placed next to the line containing its anchor
point.  But if that's not possible (because placing the float there
would shorten the line enough that the anchor point no longer fits),
then the *float* gets pushed down so that it doesn't intersect the line.

So, logically, we can't be sure we've placed the float at a position
until we've gotten to the first line breaking opportunity at or after
its anchor point.  But more on that later, after my other observations.

### The width available for a line wrapped around floats is a function of that line's height ###

Because of the [float placement
rules](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#float-position) in CSS 2,
the float can't be above its anchor point, but it can be substantially
below its anchor point.  This can happen, for example, if there are
multiple floats that are too big to all fit next to each other, or if
some of the floats use the 'clear' property, which clears them past
other floats.  This sort of situation, with the top of a float being
substantially below its anchor point, is relatively common on Wikipedia.

When this happens, the lines that come logically after the float have to
wrap around the float.  A later float might be wider than a float before
it, which means that the available width for the lines that are wrapping
around floats might decrease with downward movement.  The rules for
wrapping lines around floats say that the lines must not intersect any
floats whose vertical positions they overlap with.  (In particular,
[section 9.5 of CSS 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#floats)
says "A line box is next to a float when there exists a vertical
position that satisfies all of these four conditions: (a) at or below
the top of the line box, (b) at or above the bottom of the line box, (c)
below the top margin edge of the float, and (d) above the bottom margin
edge of the float.")

This, in turn, means that making an individual line taller might reduce
the amount of horizontal space available to it.  An implementation that
fails to consider this (which happens in a number of implementations,
actually, but Gecko gets it mostly right) ends up with text overlapping
the upper part of the float, as in
[this screenshot](https://bug384376.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=268303).
(This also applies to elements establishing new block formatting
contexts that wrap around floats; Gecko doesn't get that case right.)

This, in turn, means that placing something new on a line (for example,
an inline image) that fits horizontally might not fit because it makes
the line taller which in turn reduces the available width for the line.

### 'vertical-align' is tricky ###
